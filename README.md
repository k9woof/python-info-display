Morning information to run off of an rpi at login

4 basic information scripts which manipulate and display data from 4 apis:
-bus-times.py 
-weather.py
-timetable.py
-daily-verse.py

These are then displayed in a wonderful terminal GUI in display-script.py
Display-script.py is designed to be ran at login in an RPI's terminal (for example on a Pi Zero 2 W with Raspbian OS Lite)
